      <p class='final-words'><i>The GTA saga has also come along with many controversies because of its violent and sexual content. But, in reality, lets face it, this has only boosted up the saga's popularity in the past 26 years it has existed. Eventhought gamers know what to expect with GTA games, this "free" advertisement is what makes it's way into non-gaming people as those are the ones that actually feel ofended by the game's content.</i></p>
